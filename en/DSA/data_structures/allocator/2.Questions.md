# Self-Check Questions

- Why is an allocator needed if there are `new` and `delete`?
- Why were some functions of allocators moved to `allocator_traits`?
- What are the advantages and disadvantages of garbage collection compared to manual memory cleanup?

# Additional Questions

- Suppose you are implementing your own allocator for **fixed-size** objects based on a static array.

You want the corresponding cells of the array to be **reusable** when any object is deleted.

Consider what data structure and operations you might need for an efficient implementation.

- Java has a set of data structures with the prefix `Weak`.

If an object is only referenced in those structures, the garbage collector will still collect it.

What do you think such structures might be used for?
