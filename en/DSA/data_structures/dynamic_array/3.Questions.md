# Self-Check Questions

- What is the peculiarity of **amortized** complexity analysis?
- Prove the complexity of the **additive** approach to expansion on your own.
- Prove the complexity of the **multiplicative** approach to expansion on your own.
- What is common and different about dynamic arrays in different programming languages?

# Additional Questions

- Prove the asymptotic behavior of the **multiplicative** approach using the **accounting method** of estimation.

- Suppose we want to reduce $C$ by $(\lambda + 1)$ times when there are too many deletions.
Describe the condition for reduction under which the amortized complexity of adding/removing from the end will remain $O(1)$.

- It is obvious that **in the worst case**, some of the operations of adding to the end will take $O(N)$ operations of **moving**.
Describe an implementation where each operation of adding to the end does **at worst** $O(1)$ operations of moving.

- Why do you think it is useful to use the parameter $\lambda = 0.5$ instead of $\lambda = 1$?
(consider from the perspective of memory reuse).
