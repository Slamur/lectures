# Hash Table

Up to this point, we have discussed that in the case of constructing a bijection between keys and integer **indices**, we can use an "array-based dictionary."

But in the case of hash functions, we must always consider the possible cases of collisions and successfully **resolve** them.

Data structures that use hash functions and apply some collision resolution techniques are called **hash tables**.

## General Principles

Typically, hash tables are built on the basis of arrays, where each key corresponds to a specific cell:

- a request regarding key $K$ is received;
- the hash $H(K)$ is computed;
- the cell number $P = H(K) \mod C$ is computed, where $C$ is the number of cells in the dictionary.
- if necessary, collision resolution is performed when this cell is already occupied by another key.

## Collision Resolution

Currently, there are two main principles for resolving collisions: the bucket method and open addressing.

### Bucket Method

Instead of directly storing the value of the hash table cell, it starts storing a sequence of pairs (key, value).

The sequence is most often a linked list, but it can be any data structure that can efficiently perform the following operations:

- sequentially iterate over elements / search for an element;
- add an element;
- remove an element by iterator.

The collision resolution itself looks quite simple:

- check for the presence of the sought key using a **equality** comparison function.
  - the search itself can be linear (in the case of a linked list) or based on other parameters of the key.
- if the key is not in the cell - add the key/association as a new element of the cell.
- return the corresponding iterator.

### Open Addressing

Open addressing, unlike the bucket method, continues to work with a one-dimensional array of values.

In the case of a collision for a key, a search for a new cell begins - often the rule is expressed as a special transition function.

The search continues iteratively until an empty cell or a cell with the sought key is found.

This is true for both adding a new key and searching for an already existing one.

#### Deleting Keys

Due to the nature of cell searching in open addressing, deleting keys must be done particularly carefully:

- either the cell is simply marked as "deleted" and not used further;
- or additional actions are taken to "move" keys to maintain search consistency.

## Complexity of Operations

Suppose the size of the hash table array is $C$, and the number of keys in it is $N$.

### Amortized Estimate

When choosing a "good" hash function, the **average** number of operations for resolving collisions will be $O(\frac{N}{C})$.

The value $\frac{N}{C}$ is called the **load factor** - it is one of the important criteria when working with a hash table.

As the load factor increases, there is a natural decline in the efficiency of collision resolution, so the hash table **is rebuilt**:

- for the bucket method, there is no clear boundary when rebuilding is necessary. It is usually considered that a load factor from 1 to 3 is quite acceptable.
- for open addressing, the load factor cannot exceed 1 by definition. Therefore, it is often maintained at a level not higher than 0.6 - 0.75.

The total amortized estimate is equal to $O(1)$:

- $O(\frac{N}{C})$ **on average** for each key request;
- rebuilding the table takes $O(C)$, but is done rarely (the proof is analogous to the situation with dynamic arrays).

### Worst Case

It is quite obvious that in the worst case, operations with keys can be performed in $O(N)$ instead of the expected $O(1)$:

- all keys end up in the same bucket;
- searching for an empty cell in open addressing degenerates into checking almost all cells of the table.

In real life, this happens infrequently, but it is always worth remembering. Usually, this is caused by one of two factors:

- the choice of an unsuitable hash function.
- a targeted attack on the sought algorithm.

### Iterating Over Keys

In a simple case, iteration is performed in $O(C + N)$:

- iterate over all cells of the hash table, even empty ones.
- for all cells with keys, perform the corresponding action within the iteration.

It is also very important to understand that in such a case, iteration is performed in an order related to the hash functions of the keys and the parameter $C$.

In most situations, this order is difficult to predict, so it is usually considered that the order of iteration over the hash table **is not ordered** by any criterion.

#### Linked Hash Table

For more efficient processing, the principle of the "linked hash table" is used:

- each entry with a key is now a cell of a special linked list;
- when adding a new key, it is added to the end of the corresponding list.
- this approach allows ignoring empty cells and performing iteration in $O(N)$.

Another advantage of this approach is often the ordering of iteration **by the time of the last access to the key** (least recently used).

Note that this is not iteration in ascending or descending order of the keys themselves; it is the order of insertion/updating of keys within the hash table.
