# C++

In C++, there are implementations of dictionaries/sets based on hash tables (most commonly based on the **bucket method**):

- `std::unordered_map` and `std::unordered_multimap` for dictionaries/multi-dictionaries.
- `std::unordered_set` and `std::unordered_multiset` for sets/multi-sets.

The hash function computation is performed through the template parameter `Hash = std::hash<T>`, and key comparison is done via `KeyEqual = std::equal_to<T>`:

- `Hash` must be a functional object that computes a hash of type `size_t` from the corresponding instance.
- `std::hash` is implemented for `std::string`, but not for other common sequence types.
- `KeyEqual` is used for comparing keys within the same bucket.
- `std::equal_to` by default compares objects using the `==` operator.

## Standard Operations of Dictionary/Set

- `begin` and `end`;
  - the iterator behaves like a pointer to:
    - set - the element itself.
    - dictionary - `std::pair<key, value>`.
- `find` - find an iterator for a given key/element.
- `insert` - add a value;
- `erase` - remove a value;
  - it is recommended to remove via iterator.
- the operator `[]` (only in dictionaries):
  - returns the value for the given key.
  - if such a key does not exist, it **creates** an entry with the given key and a **default** value.
- `count` - the number of keys/elements with a given value.
  - in multi-structures, it iterates over all "equal" elements in $O(cnt)$.

# Java

In Java, there are implementations of dictionaries/sets based on hash tables (most commonly based on the **bucket method**):

- `HashMap` and `LinkedHashMap` for dictionaries.
- `HashSet` and `LinkedHashSet` for sets.

`Linked` structures use an additional linked list for iterating over stored values.

The standard methods `hashCode` and `equals`, inherited from the `Object` class, are used:

- by default, they compare addresses in dynamic memory (reference comparison).
- methods are overridden for the `String` class, but not for arrays and collections.
- it is strongly recommended for user-defined objects to override these methods according to the requirements of the task.

## Standard Operations of Dictionary/Set

Provided by the interfaces `Set` and `Map`, respectively.

- `entrySet` (only in dictionaries) - an iterable pseudo-set of pairs (key, value).
  - `keySet` and `values` - derived pseudo-structures - wrappers.
- `contains` / `containsKey` - check for the presence of an element/key in the structure.
- `add` / `put` - add an element/association.
- `remove` - remove the node corresponding to the value.
- `get` (only in dictionaries) - the associated value with the given key (or `null`).
  - `getOrDefault` - instead of `null`, returns the `default` parameter of the method.

# Python

In Python, there are implementations of dictionaries/sets based on hash tables (most commonly based on **open addressing**):

- `dict` for dictionaries.
- `set` for sets.

The standard methods `__hash__` and `__eq__` are used - in this case, the object is considered **hashable**:

- by default, they compare addresses in dynamic memory (reference comparison).
- overridden for immutable types (e.g., `str`) and immutable collections (e.g., `tuple`).
  - immutable collections are hashable only if their elements are hashable.
  - mutable collections (`list`, `dict`, etc.) are not hashable.
- it is strongly recommended for user-defined objects to override these methods according to the requirements of the task.

## Standard Operations of Dictionary/Set

- `items` (only in dictionaries) - an iterable pseudo-set of pairs (key, value).
  - `keys` and `values` - derived pseudo-structures - wrappers.
- `in` - check for the presence of an element/key in the structure.
- `add` - add an element/association.
- `remove` / `pop` - remove an element/key.
- `get` (only in dictionaries) - the associated value with the given key (or `default` parameter).
  - raises `KeyError` if the key is absent, but the `default` parameter is not specified.
- the operator `[]` is similar to `get`, but without the option to specify `default`.

## Additional Modifications of Dictionary

In the `collections` package, there are two modifications of the dictionary:

- `Counter` - a frequency dictionary based on the collection passed to the constructor.
- `defaultdict` - instead of `KeyError`, it will create a new entry with the value obtained from calling the function specified in the constructor.
