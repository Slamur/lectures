# Sets

Earlier, we became acquainted with the abstraction of the data structure "dictionary," which stores associations (key, value).

Let's recall the main operations of a dictionary:

- set an association (key, value).
- remove the association for a given key.
- retrieve the value associated with the key.

A data structure abstraction very similar to a dictionary in functionality is the **"set,"** which is a collection of homogeneous **unique** elements.

Let's list the main operations of a set:

- add an element to the set.
- remove an element from the set.
- check for the presence of an element in the set.

## Relationship Between Dictionary and Set

The concepts of set and dictionary are closely related:

- a set is essentially like a dictionary where the keys of the dictionary are the elements of the set, and all values are equal to `true`.
- the set of keys of a dictionary is, in essence, a set, which is why dictionaries often have additional functions like "check for the presence of a key in the dictionary."

Due to this, most subsequent discussions and modifications related to dictionaries will automatically also pertain to sets.

If there is a distinction between the "dictionary / set" situation, it will be explicitly stated.

## Mathematical Operations with Sets

Unlike a dictionary, a set is also a mathematical abstraction.

Therefore, additional sets of binary operations are often defined for sets, resulting in a **new set**:

- intersection of sets - all **matching** elements in both operands;
- union of sets - all elements represented **in at least one** operand;
- difference of sets - all elements represented in the left operand, BUT NOT in the right;
- etc.

For a set of keys/associations of dictionaries, similar operations can also be defined, but much less frequently.

## Multiset

In the definition of a set, there is a requirement for **uniqueness** of elements.

However, there are situations where it is necessary to store different elements in a set, but unique concerning the problem being solved.

In such cases, we talk about a **multiset** - it has a similar set of operations (add / remove / check), but does not require full uniqueness of the stored elements.

A multiset is closest in nature to a frequency array - a dictionary (key, count).
