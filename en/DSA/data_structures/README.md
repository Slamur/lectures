# Data Structures

Description of the main data structures:

- concepts and terminology;
- implementation examples;
- usage in C++ / Java / Python;
- application examples.

The sections are intended to be studied in the following order:

- [Iterator](./iterator) - the concepts of "sequence" and "iterator".
- [Amortized complexity](./complexity/1.Amortized.md) - "amortized" complexity (asymptotics).
- [Dynamic array](./dynamic_array) - dynamic array.
- [Dictionary. Array-based](./dictionary_and_set/array_based) - the concept of "dictionary"; array-based dictionary.
- [Allocator (optional)](./allocator) - allocator.
- [Linked list](./linked_list) - linked list.
- [Stack](./stack) - stack.
- [Queue](./queue) - queue and deque.
- [Sorting](./sorting) - sorting.
- [Dictionary. Hash table](./dictionary_and_set/hash_table) - the concept of "set"; hash function and hash table.
- [Tree. Rooted and binary](./tree) - trees: rooted and binary.
- [Dictionary. Search tree](./dictionary_and_set/search_tree) - search trees.
- [Priority queue. Binary heap](./priority_queue) - the concept of "priority queue"; binary heap.
