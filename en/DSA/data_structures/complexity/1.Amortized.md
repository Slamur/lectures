# Amortized Complexity Analysis

Some dynamic data structures cannot guarantee the efficiency of performing a single fixed operation $Op$.

At the same time, they can guarantee the efficiency of performing $N$ similar operations.

In this case, we talk about **amortized complexity analysis**. It is defined as the total complexity of performing $N$ operations divided by $N$ (compare it to the arithmetic mean).

Formally, the amortized complexity of operation $Op$ is calculated as $O(\frac{Op_1 + Op_2 + \dots + Op_N}{N})$.

In most situations, such an estimate is sufficient, as many data structures are originally designed to handle a multitude of similar operations.

## Accounting Method of Estimation

One convenient way to compute amortized estimates is the **accounting method**.

The general essence of the principle is as follows:

- assign a **cost** (expressed in _coins_) to each operation within the structure;
- calculate how many _coins_ a given element of the structure needs along the entire path from "addition" to "removal".
