# Comparator

If the order relation is a mathematical abstraction, then its implementation in programming languages is a **comparator**.

In languages, there are two main variants of a comparator:

- a direct analogue of the order relation $F$ - a boolean "less than" function.
- a combination of order relation $F$ and equivalence $G$ - a function that returns one of three results: "less than" / "equal" / "greater".

Also, some languages allow defining special comparators for an entire data type instead of defining one for each sort separately.

# C++

## Sorting

- `std::reverse` performs reversal of sequences;
- `std::sort` and `std::stable_sort` perform unstable and stable sorts, respectively.
  - additional parameters can include a comparator and additional policies.

## Comparator

C++ uses the principle of a boolean comparator (operator $x < y$).

For comparison:

- you can define a separate boolean comparison function specific to this sort.
  - including a lambda function, which can be described right at the function parameter.

- at the data type level, you can define `operator<`.
  - all other comparison operators are defined based on it.
  - (up to C++ 20) it is used directly in sorts.

- (starting from C++ 20) a new operator `<=>` ("spaceship operator") is introduced.
  - it returns `less` / `equal` / `greater` results (must be compared with $0$).

- (starting from C++ 20) sorts use the functional object `std::less`.
  - by default, it calls `operator<` for the passed pair of values.

## Lexicographic Comparison

In C++, lexicographic comparison is defined by default for the following data structures:

- `std::string`;
- `std::pair`;
- `std::tuple` and `std::tie`;
- `std::array`;
- `std::vector`;
- most other sequence types.

Accordingly, more often than not, instead of describing complex comparator logic:

- in the case of a class with multiple attributes, it is recommended to pack into `std::tie`.
- in the case of combining multiple values, it is recommended to pack into `std::pair` or `std::tuple`.

# Java

## Sorting

- the static class `Arrays` provides the method `sort` for arrays.
  - additional overload parameters - boundaries of the sorted segment and comparator.
  - sorting for primitive types and object types differs.
- the static class `Collections` provides a similar method `sort` for the `List` interface.
  - also provides a method `reverse`.

## Comparator

Java uses the principle of three-way comparison ("less than" / "equal" / "greater"):

- it returns an integer;
- negative means "less than";
- positive means "greater than";
- zero means "equal".

For comparison:

- the `Comparator` interface is used to describe comparison logic that is not tied to a data type.
  - it is necessary to implement the method `int compare(T a, T b)`.
  - it is a **functional interface** - can be expressed as a lambda function.

- the `Comparable` interface is defined at the level of the entire data type.
  - it is necessary to implement the method `int compareTo(T other)`.

## Lexicographic Comparison

In Java, the lexicographic comparator is defined only for the data structures `String` and `StringBuilder` (through `Comparable`).

Collections and arrays do not have a default comparator.

# Python

## Sorting

For the `list` class, the following operations are defined:

- methods `sort` and `reverse` for in-place sorting.
- functions `sorted` and `reversed` for creating a sorted copy.
  - `[::-1]` also creates a reversed copy of the list.

Sorts (`sort` and `sorted`) accept the following additional parameters:

- `reverse` for sorting in descending order (more efficient than sorting + reversing).
- `key` - a function for calculating the _sorting key_.

## Comparator

For comparing objects:

- at the data type level, you can override the operators `__lt__` and others.
- at the sorting level, you can specify the sorting key.
  - to use three-way comparison, it is necessary to transform this comparison into a key using a special function.

## Lexicographic Comparison

In Python, lexicographic comparison is defined by default for the following data structures:

- `str`;
- `tuple`;
- `list`.

Accordingly, more often than not, instead of describing complex comparator logic, it is sufficient to pack values into `tuple` or `list`.
