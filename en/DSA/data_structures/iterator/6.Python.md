# Iterator in Python

An iterator can be any object that contains the method `__next__(self)`:

- it advances to the next element;
  - if there is no next element, it raises the `StopIteration` exception
- it returns a new value.

## Generator

**Generator** - a simple form of an iterator, implemented using the `yield` operator:

- it returns the value passed to `yield`;
- it hands control back to the external code until the next call to `__next__`.

```py
def generate_ints(N):
   for i in range(N):
       yield i
```

## External Operations

There is an operation `next(it)`, which is essentially a wrapper for directly calling `__next__` outside of a `for-each` loop.

```py
gen = generate_ints(3)
gen
<generator object generate_ints at ...>
next(gen)
0
next(gen)
1
next(gen)
2
next(gen)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "stdin", line 1, in <module>
  File "stdin", line 2, in generate_ints
StopIteration
```

# Sequence in Python

A sequence can be any object that contains the method `__iter__(self)`, which returns an iterator object (compare with Java).

An iterator can also be a sequence if necessary.

## Foreach

Any sequence can be iterated in the format:

```py
for value in sequence:
  # process value
```

## Utility Functions

Utility functions are defined for sequences, for example:

- `enumerate` - iterates over pairs $(pos, value)$ - essentially indexing the sequence;
- `zip` - iterates over pairs $(a_p, b_p)$ for two sequences $a$ and $b$.
