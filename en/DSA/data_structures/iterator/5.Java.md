# Iterator in Java

An iterator is represented by the interface `Iterator<T>`, which contains the following methods:

```java
boolean hasNext(); // checks if next exists

T next(); // advance iterator and returns element

T remove(); // (optional) removes and returns last iterated value
```

Note that in Java, the iterator is initially positioned "before the first" element.

# Sequences in Java

Sequences are represented by the interface `Iterable<T>`, which contains the following method:

```java
Iterator<T> iterator();
```

## Usage Principle

A common usage scenario for an iterator looks like this:

```java
for (var it = sequence.iterator(); it.hasNext(); ) {
  T value = it.next();
  // process value
}
```

### Foreach

In Java, `for-each` is implemented in the format:

```java
for (T value : sequence) {
  // process value
}
```

### ConcurrentModificationException

When attempting to modify the structure of a sequence while iterating through it (except for allowed cases using `remove`), a corresponding exception will be thrown.

# Streams

Starting from Java 8, Java introduced the ability to process sequences through the functional interface `Stream`, alongside `Iterable` and `Iterator`.

`Stream` provides a wide range of functions for processing sequences, such as:

- `map` - transforms each element of the sequence, returning a `Stream`;
- `filter` - filters data based on a given condition, returning a `Stream`;
- `reduce` - accumulates a single value over a dataset using a specified binary operation, returning the result (analogous to `std::accumulate` in C++);
- `forEach` - performs a specified action for each element, returning nothing (most similar to working with `Iterator`);
- `toArray`, `toList`, `toMap`, etc. - transitions from `Stream` to a specified data structure.
