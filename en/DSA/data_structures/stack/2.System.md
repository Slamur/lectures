# Stack overflow - what stack?!

Well, you have learned that there is an abstraction/approach to usage called "stack".

But in that case, what does the error "stack overflow" mean? The error is so popular that it even gave its name to [a website of the same name](https://stackoverflow.com/).

You have probably encountered this error at least once:

- during too deep (often infinite) recursion;
- when trying to allocate a **large** static array inside `main` (specific to C++).

But where is the stack here?

## System stack - memory area

Every process is allocated a certain amount of memory, divided into several areas.

You have already encountered one of these areas multiple times - this is dynamic memory, which you worked with using the `new` and `delete` operators.

But in fact, you have previously encountered a smaller but no less important memory area - the **system stack**.

It is important to note that by default, the system stack of a process is often significantly smaller than dynamic memory.

The system stack usually stores two types of values:

- all local variables that are not explicitly stored in dynamic memory.
- parameters of the called function and information necessary for returning.

I think it is becoming clear why "stack overflow" most often occurred in the cases described above.

But why is this memory area called the system **stack**? Where are the `push` / `pop` operations implemented in it?

### Local variables and stack

Let's consider the lifecycle of a local variable:

- the scope begins, within which the variable exists (for example, a block `{ }`).
- all necessary actions with the variable occur.
- the scope ends, and the variable is cleared.

It is easy to notice that if one scope is **nested** within another, then the variables in the nested scope will be cleared before the variables in the outer scope - this is a clear implementation of the LIFO principle.

### Recursion and stack

Suppose you are in function $F$, from which you call function $G$.

In this case, the following are placed on the system stack:

- values of local variables of function $F$;
- meta-information about "where to return" after returning from $G$;
- (when calling $G$) values of parameters for calling function $G$.
- (when returning from $G$) the result of the computation (if any).

The first two points are usually combined into the concept of "activation frame" - it will be removed from the stack upon returning from function $G$, and until then, it will occupy part of the memory.

Suppose that within $G$ another function call was made (let's denote the called function as $H$).

In this case, upon returning from recursion, the activation frame of function $G$ (which was placed later) will be removed and processed first, and only then the frame of function $F$ - again, we encounter the LIFO principle when working with data in the system stack.

### Throwing Exceptions

Most likely, you have written a program that threw some exception at least once during its execution.

If you did not catch the exception, you might have seen the exact location of the error on the screen.

Often, the location of the error is displayed in the form of a **stacktrace** - a set of pairs (function name, line number).

Essentially, this stacktrace represents a version of the recursion stack at the moment the exception was thrown.

#### Logic Based on Exceptions

As you know, when an exception is thrown, the execution of the current function abruptly stops, and then there is a sharp rise up the recursion stack until the `try-catch` block is reached.

This mechanism may seem very convenient for quickly returning from recursion even outside of exceptional situations.

NO, this is a bad coding practice:

- Throwing an exception is an expensive operation;
- The code becomes difficult to debug.
- Some compiler mechanisms and optimizations do not work with exceptions (but work with `return`).
