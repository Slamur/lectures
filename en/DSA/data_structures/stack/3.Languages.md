# Implementations

## Dynamic array / linked list

As mentioned above, a stack in programming languages can easily be implemented based on the built-in implementations of dynamic arrays and linked lists:

- C++: `std::vector` / `std::forward_list` / `std::list`;
- Java: `ArrayList` / `LinkedList`;
- Python: `list`.

### `std::stack` in C++

C++ additionally provides a wrapper class `std::stack`.

This class is an external interface over an internal container - a data storage defined using the template parameter `Container`.

## Deque

In all the languages considered, a stack can be implemented based on the built-in implementation of the `deque` structure - a double-ended queue. This structure will be discussed in the next lecture, so it is not used in this lecture.

## Classes for working with multithreading

These structures **ARE NOT recommended** for use in single-threaded applications:

- Java: `Stack`
- Python: `queue.LifoQueue`

They are synchronized by default, which makes them convenient for multithreaded applications but significantly slows down/complicates their use in single-threaded scenarios.
