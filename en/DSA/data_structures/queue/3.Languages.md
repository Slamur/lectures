# C++

## `std::queue`

Similarly, `std::stack` is a wrapper class with operations:

- `back` and `front`;
- `push`;
- `pop`.

The container (template parameter `Container`) must implement the operations:

- `back`;
- `push_back`;
- `front`;
- `pop_front`.

The main candidates for `std::queue` are:

- `std::deque` - the default option;
- `std::list`.

## `std::deque`

Although it is not entirely obvious, `std::deque` in C++ is implemented based on the **block principle** - and, accordingly, occupies an intermediate position between `std::vector` and `std::list` in various aspects.

### Invalidating iterators/pointers

It is guaranteed that inserting at the beginning/end of `std::deque` does not invalidate pointers to the other stored elements.

### Memory consumption

Due to the block structure, `std::deque` is forced to store an entire block of fixed size even for a single element.

This can lead to unexpected effects, especially when storing many `std::deque`, each of which holds a small number of elements.

I will quote from the C++ documentation: `On the other hand, deques typically have large minimal memory cost; a deque holding just one element has to allocate its full internal array (e.g. 8 times the object size on 64-bit libstdc++; 16 times the object size or 4096 bytes, whichever is larger, on 64-bit libc++).`

### Indexing

Due to the block implementation based on a dynamic array, `std::deque` can also efficiently perform **indexing** requests.

Unlike `std::vector`, where indexing is performed with a single pointer dereference, `std::deque` uses two dereferences - one to access the block and another to access the element within the block.

### Insertion/deletion from a specified position

For the record, `std::deque` cannot efficiently insert/delete values from a specified position (similar to `std::vector`).

# Java

Java provides two interfaces `Queue` and `Deque` respectively:

- `poll` / `pollLast` and `pollFirst` for insertion;
- `peek` / `peekLast` and `peekFirst` for access;
- `poll` / `pollLast` and `pollFirst` for extraction.

Additionally, `Deque` contains methods `push` and `pop` to emulate stack operations - they essentially redirect to the methods described above.

It is recommended to use the `ArrayDeque` class as an implementation - it contains a standard **circular buffer** internally.

# Python

The `collections` package contains the `deque` structure with basic operations:

- `appendleft` and `append` for inserting at the beginning and end respectively;
- `popleft` and `pop` for removing from the beginning and end respectively;
- `[0]` and `[-1]` (indexing operators) for accessing the first and last elements.
