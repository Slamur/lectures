## Queue

In the last lecture, you were introduced to the "stack" structure, which implements the "LIFO" principle.

This lecture is dedicated to a similar structure that implements the "FIFO" principle ("First in, first out") - the **queue**:

- `push(value)` - add a value to the **end**;
- `front()` - look at the value at the **beginning**;
- `pop()` - remove a value from the **beginning**.

I could provide examples of queues in real life, but the name of the structure speaks for itself.

## Deque

A generalization of the queue idea is the **double-ended queue** - abbreviated as **deque**.

- `push_front(value)` and `push_back(value)`;
- `front()` and `back()`;
- `pop_front()` and `pop_back()`.

Most often, the language implements a deque, which is then used as a stack/queue when necessary.
