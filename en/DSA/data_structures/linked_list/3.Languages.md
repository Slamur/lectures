# C++

The linked list is represented by two classes `std::forward_list` (singly linked) and `std::list` (doubly linked).

## Available Operations

Unlike `std::vector`, these classes do not support indexing as a separate operation (since they cannot do it in $O(1)$ ).

At the same time, you can easily move to the desired index in $O(index)$ (or $O(size - index)$ in the case of `std::list`), using the functions `std::next` / `std::prev` / `std::advance`.

## Invalidating Iterators

Unlike a dynamic array, iterators are NOT invalidated when new values are inserted/when the order of nodes in the list is changed.

An iterator is invalidated ONLY when the corresponding value is removed from the list.

This allows, for example, to perform reverse mapping "value - iterator" in the case of [unique values](#all-values-in-the-list-are-unique).

# Java

The linked list is represented by the class `LinkedList`.

Due to encapsulation, working with individual nodes of the linked list is not possible.

This turns `LinkedList` into just another implementation of a dynamic array (with fast insertion at the beginning, but slow indexing).

If direct manipulation with nodes is necessary, it is suggested to implement the linked list independently (based on an array or node class).

# Python

There is no built-in class available.
