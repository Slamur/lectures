# Disclaimer

While I advocate for the use of pseudocode in such lectures, I also understand that most potential readers are only well-versed in C++.

Therefore, the code examples in this lecture will be written in C++.

It is important to understand that the concepts described in this lecture are applicable (possibly with minor changes) to many imperative languages (Java, Python, etc.). So try to grasp not only the C++ code but also the underlying abstract ideas and principles.
