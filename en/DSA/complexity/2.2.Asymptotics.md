## Number of Operations as a Function of Parameters

### Important Operations

For any algorithm, we can identify a set of simple operations that form its logical basis.

For example,

- for calculating the sum of integers from $1$ to $N$ using a loop, the important operation would be addition.
- for most sorting algorithms, the important operations are comparison for greater/less and indexing.

We will call such operations **important**.

### "Sufficiently" Efficient Algorithm

Suppose we have an algorithm that depends on a single integer $N$.

Let's denote by $T(N)$ the function that calculates the number of **important** operations of our algorithm for a given $N$.

We consider an algorithm to be **sufficiently efficient** if the value of $T(N)$ fits within the specified upper bounds.

## Asymptotics - A Simpler Function with the Same Behavior

Often, finding the analytical form of the function $T(N)$ for the number of important operations can be too complex.

At the same time, we are not interested in the exact quantity, but only its **estimate**.

Therefore, to simplify the calculation, instead of $T(N)$, its **asymptotics** is used - the function $F(N)$ with the following properties:

- The function $F(N)$ is an upper bound estimate for $T(N)$;
- Ideally, the function $F(N)$ behaves **similarly** to $T(N).
- Among all such $F(N)$, the function with the least number of terms and coefficients is chosen.

### Formal Definition

We will call the function $F(N)$ the **asymptotic** of the algorithm with the number of operations $T(N)$ if

- $T(N) = \Theta(F(N))$
	- In specific cases, it is sufficient that $T(N) = O(F(N))$;
- $F(N)$ contains only **incomparable** terms.
- The coefficients of the terms are equal to $1$.
- $F(N)$ does not contain terms and multipliers that do not depend on the algorithm's parameters (if you have such, make them parameters).

**Definition**: We will call the terms $X(N)$ and $Y(N)$ **incomparable** if

- $X(N) \ne O(Y(N))$
- $Y(N) \ne O(X(N))$

### Examples

#### Example 1

$F(N) = N^2$ **is** an asymptotic for $T(N) = 3 \cdot N^2 + 20$.

**Proof**:

<details> <summary> </summary>

- $T(N) = O(F(N))$ - see example 1 in the definition of "Big O".
- $T(N) = \Omega(F(N))$ - there exist $C = 1$ and $N_0 = 1$ such that $N^2 \le 1 \cdot (3 \cdot N^2 + 2)$ for $N \ge 1.
- The coefficient of the term $N^2$ is $1$.

</details>

Essentially, this means that the function $N^2$ is convenient to use for estimating the behavior of the function $3 \cdot N^2 + 20$ for large $N$.

For example, when increasing $N$ by a factor of 10, both functions $F(N)$ and $T(N)$ will increase by approximately a factor of 100.

#### Example 2

$F(N, M) = N^2 + M \cdot N + M^3$ **is** an asymptotic for $T(N, M) = N^2 + 3 \cdot M \cdot N + \frac{M^3}{10} + 100 \cdot M^2 + 20$.

**Proof**:

<details> <summary> </summary>

- $T(N, M) = O(F(N, M))$ - there exist $C = 3$, $N_0 = 1$, and $M_0 = 100$ such that

  $N^2 + 3 \cdot M \cdot N + \frac{M^3}{10} + 100 \cdot M^2 + 20 \le 4 \cdot (N^2 + M \cdot N + M^3)$ for $N \ge 1$ and $M \ge 100$.

- $T(N, M) = \Omega(F(N, M))$ - there exist $C = 10$, $N_0 = 1$, $M_0 = 1$ such that

  $N^2 + M \cdot N + M^3 \le 10 \cdot (N^2 + 3 \cdot M \cdot N + \frac{M^3}{10} + 100 \cdot M^2 + 20)$ for $N \ge 1$ and $M \ge 1$.

- The coefficients of the terms $N^2$, $M \cdot N$, $M^3$ are equal to $1$;

- $M^3$ is comparable to $M^2$, so $M^2$ is not included in $F(N, M)$.

- $20$ does not depend on the parameters, so it is not included in $F(N, M)$.

</details>

**Note**:

<details> <summary> </summary>

It can be noticed that

- if $M \le N$, then $M \cdot N \le N^2$;
- if $N \le M$, then $M \cdot N \le M^3$.

From this, it can be concluded that in reality $F(N, M) = N^2 + M^3.

Yes, such an estimate is possible, but in most cases, the simple analysis method provided in the example will be sufficient.

</details>

#### Example 3

$F(N) = N^3$ **is not** an asymptotic for $T(N) = 3 \cdot N^2 + 20$.

**Proof**:

<details> <summary> </summary>

$T(N) \ne \Omega(F(N))$: for all $C \ge 0$, the inequality $N^3 \le C \cdot (3 \cdot N^2 + 2)$ holds only for $N \le 3 \cdot C$.

Essentially, $N^3$ is an "upper bound estimate", but it grows significantly faster than $3 \cdot N^2 + 20$.

This means that for large $N$, the estimate using $N^3$ will be too **pessimistic** for analysis.

</details>

#### Example 4

$F(N) = N$ **is not** an asymptotic for $T(N) = 3 \cdot N^2 + 20$.

**Proof**:

<details> <summary> </summary>

$T(N) \ne O(F(N))$ - see example 3 from the definition of "Big O".

Essentially, regardless of the choice of $C$, the function $C \cdot N$ grows significantly slower than $3 \cdot N^2 + 20.

This means that for large $N$, the estimate using $C \cdot N$ will be too **optimistic** for analysis.

</details>

#### Example 5

$F(N) = N^2 + N$ **is not** an asymptotic for $T(N) = 3 \cdot N^2 + 20$.

**Proof**:

<details> <summary> </summary>

The terms $N^2$ and $N$ are comparable to each other, as $N = O(N^2)$.

For simplicity of description, only the **important for estimation** terms are left in the asymptotic - in this case, it is $N^2$.

When checking for "Big O" for the functions $N^2$ and $N^2 + N$, only the constant $C$ will differ (but its presence is not guaranteed).

</details>

#### Example 6

$F(N) = 2 \cdot N^2$ **is not** an asymptotic for $T(N) = 3 \cdot N^2 + 20$.

**Proof**:

<details> <summary> </summary>

The coefficient of the term $N^2$ is $2 \ne 1$.

For simplicity of description, functions without extra coefficients are used as asymptotics - in this case, it is $N^2$.

When checking for "Big O" for the functions $N^2$ and $2 \cdot N^2$, only the constant $C$ will differ (but its presence is not guaranteed).

</details>

## Conclusions

- The efficiency of an algorithm is often evaluated through the number of "important" operations.
- Expressing the exact quantity of such operations can be very costly.
- Therefore, instead of the exact function, the asymptotics is used - a simpler function related to the exact quantity by the $\Theta$ relationship.
- To standardize, constant multipliers and comparable terms are not used in the asymptotics.
