# Asymptotic Analysis

Evaluating the efficiency of algorithms in terms of time by assessing the number of operations.

- [Prerequisites](0.Prerequisites.md) - prior knowledge necessary for understanding the material.
- [Concept.Basic operations](1.Concept.BasicOperations.md) - introduction to the topic; the relationship between execution time and the number of operations.
- [Concept.O_large](2.1.Concept.O_large.md) - the terms "Big O", "Theta", and "Omega".
- [Concept.Asymptotics](2.2.Concept.Asymptotics.md) - the term "asymptotics".
- [Applications](3.Applications.md) - operations on asymptotics; the most commonly encountered types of asymptotics.
- [Exercises](4.Exercises.md) - a set of questions and tasks for independent solution.
