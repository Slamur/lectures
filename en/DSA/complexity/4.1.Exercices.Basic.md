# Estimating execution time

## Statement
You have written an algorithm and are about to run it on a computing machine.

You know:
- the total number of operations of the algorithm;
- the number of operations the machine can perform per second.

For each case, estimate how many seconds the algorithm will take to execute.

## Tasks

Number of algorithm operations | Machine performance | Answer | Comment
---|---|---|---
$10^4$ operations | $10^8$ operations / sec | <details> <summary> </summary> $0.0001$ seconds. </details> | <details> <summary> </summary> Such a small value that the program preparation for launch is likely to take longer than the actual execution time. </details>
$10^6$ operations | $10^8$ operations / sec | <details> <summary> </summary> $0.01$ seconds. </details> | <details> <summary> </summary> Practically no difference from the previous case. </details>
$5 \cdot 10^7$ operations | $10^8$ operations / sec | <details> <summary> </summary> $0.5$ seconds. </details> | <details> <summary> </summary> Not too much, but noticeable for the observer. </details>
$2 \cdot 10^9$ operations | $5 \cdot 10^8$ operations / sec. | <details> <summary> </summary> $4$ seconds.  </details> | <details> <summary> </summary> In the context of a competition, this may be critical, but in real life, it is quite a reasonable execution time. </details>
$10^{10}$ operations | $5 \cdot 10^8$ operations / sec. | <details> <summary> </summary> $20$ seconds.  </details> | <details> <summary> </summary> Suitable for some pre-calculation, but you will have to wait. </details>
$10^{12}$ operations | $2 \cdot 10^9$ operations / sec. | <details> <summary> </summary> $500$ seconds - about 8-9 minutes. </details> | <details> <summary> </summary> Note that a very "optimistic" execution speed is deliberately taken. </details>
$10^{18}$ operations | $2 \cdot 10^9$ operations / sec. | <details> <summary> </summary> $5 \cdot 10^8$ seconds - almost 16 years. </details> | <details> <summary> </summary> Comments are unnecessary. </details>

# Exercise. Asymptotics by code

## Statement

Estimate the asymptotics of the given pseudocode.

## Tasks

1. Substrings

For given string $S$ print all substrings with length $k$.

```
    N = length(S)
    For end from k to N {
      start = end - k + 1
      print(substring(S, start, end))
    }
```

What $k$ leads to smallest / largest complexity?

**Answer**

<details> <summary> </summary>

For fixed $k$ code performs $O((N - k) \cdot k)$ operations, where $N = |S|$.

$T(N, k) = (N - k) \cdot k = N \cdot k - k^2$ (decreasing parabola).

Using derivative: $T'_k(N, k) = N - 2k = 0$ => $k = \frac{N}{2}$ leads to maximal complexity $T(N) = \frac{N^2}{4} = O(N^2)$.

Minimal complexity is achieved at $k = 1$ or $k = N$: $T(N) = (N - 1) = O(N)$.

2. Three similar codes

```
    For i from 1 to N {
      For j from 1 to N {
        Print (i, j)
      }
    }

    For i from 1 to N {
      For j from 1 to i {
        Print (i, j)
      }
    }

    For i from 1 to N {
      For j from i to N {
        Print (i, j)
      }
    }
```

**Answer**

<details> <summary> </summary>

The first code performs $O(N \cdot N) = O(N^2)$ iterations.

The number of iterations in the second and third codes forms an arithmetic progression $1 + 2 + \dots + N$, which equals $\frac{(N + 1) \cdot N}{2} = O(N^2)$.

3. Index pairs

Let's consider an array $A_1 \le A_2 \le \dots \le A_N$.

```
    j = 1
    For i from 1 to N {
      While (j <= N) and (A[i] * 2 > A[j]) {
        j = j + 1
      }
      Print(i, j)
    }
```

**Answer**

<details> <summary> </summary>

Both variables $i$ and $j$ will iterate through all values from $1$ to $N$ once.

The total number of iterations is $O(N + N) = O(N)$.
