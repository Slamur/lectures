# Greedy approach

## Definition

Greedy approach is not something specific like "Dijkstra algorithm" or "Fast-Fourier Transform". 

It is more like a paradigm, a way of thinking about solution for the specific problem.

I will use here a quote from [USACO Guide](https://usaco.guide/bronze/intro-greedy):

> A greedy algorithm constructs a solution to the problem by always making a choice that looks **the best at the moment**.
>
> A greedy algorithm **never takes back** its choices, but directly constructs the final solution.
>
> For this reason, greedy algorithms are usually very efficient.
 
## Difference with other optimization approaches

There are three other main approaches to solve optimization problems:

- Brute-force approach (try all possible solutions)
- Dynamic programming approach (use overlapping subproblems to decrease complexity)
- Analytical approach (find a mathematical formula to calculate the answer directly)

You can say that analytical approach is "the greedy approach on steroids" - you know the answer directly, but usually it needs some deep insights and mathematical skills to find it.

Brute-force and dynamic programming approaches are easier to find and prove, but they require to analyze more subproblems, even ones not used in the final solution.

In real life usual choice is between greedy and dynamic programming approaches: if you can prove that greedy approach works, you usually prefer it, otherwise you go for dynamic programming.
