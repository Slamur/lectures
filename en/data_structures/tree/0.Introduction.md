# Disclaimer

While I am an advocate for using pseudocode in such lectures, I also understand that most potential readers are well-versed only in C++.

Therefore, the code examples in this lecture will be written in C++.

It is important to understand that the concepts described in this lecture are applicable (possibly with minor changes) to many imperative languages (Java, Python, etc.). So try to grasp not only the C++ code but also the underlying abstract ideas and principles.

# Graph theory

The sections in this folder contain fundamental concepts and terms essential for a comprehensive understanding of tree-like structures such as "search trees" and "binary heaps".

These materials can be viewed as an introduction to "graph theory," but it should be noted that their content is limited to the requirements of the "Data Structures" course.
