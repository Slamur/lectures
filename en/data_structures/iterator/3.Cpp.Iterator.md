# Iterators in C++

Iterators in C++ are described as structures inside or outside the sequence class.

## Iterator Tags

C++ allows for the specification of "tags" when describing an iterator - essentially meta-information about the iterator.

Such tags can be used by various standard algorithms or data structures for more efficient processing.

Here are examples of some tags:

```cpp
    using iterator_category = std::forward_iterator_tag;  // iterator type
    using difference_type   = std::ptrdiff_t;             // "distance between iterators"-type
    using value_type        = T;                          // type of value pointed by this iterator
    using reference         = value_type&;                // type returned by operator*
    using pointer           = value_type*;                // type returned by operator->
```

## Basic Operations

P.S. Most of the operations described below can have `const` and non-`const` versions.

Fundamentally, almost any iterator in C++ can perform the following operations:

- `reference operator*()` - obtaining a reference to the value corresponding to the iterator;

- `Iterator& operator++();` - prefix increment (inside the iterator);
- `Iterator operator++(int);` - postfix increment (creating a new iterator).

Additionally, most iterators can perform some of these operations:

- `pointer operator->()` - `it->m` should be equivalent to `(*it).m`;

- `friend bool operator==(const Iterator& a, const Iterator& b)` - comparison of two iterators for equality;
- `friend bool operator!=(const Iterator& a, const Iterator& b)` - similar check for inequality.

### External Operations

C++ provides some additional operations (or operator analogs) for iterators:

- `std::next(it)` / `std::prev(it)` - analogs of `operator++(int)` / `operator--(int)` and `operator+(int)`/`operator-(int)`;
- `std::advance(it, distance)` - analog of `operator+=(distance)` and `operator-=(distance)`;
- `std::distance(it_a, it_b)` - analog of `friend operator-(it_a, it_b)`.

## Iterator Hierarchy

C++ documentation describes many varieties of iterators depending on their functionality.

- **Input** - the ability for **single** iteration, access to elements **read-only**.
- **Output** - similar to Input, but access is **write-only**.
- **Forward** - **multiple** iterations "forward", access to elements **read and write**.
- **Bidirectional** - similar to Forward, but can also iterate "backward".
  - decrement operators are added.
- **RandomAccess** - the ability to "jump" across elements by any specified offset (discussed above).
  - `+=` and `-=` operators are added;
  - as well as often the operator `friend difference_type operator-(const Iterator& a, const Iterator& b)`;
- **Contiguous** - guarantees that adjacent elements are **physically close** in memory.
