# Sequence

We will call a **sequence** a set of values with the same type stored in a specific order.

## Operations

The essentially only operation applicable to a sequence is the sequential traversal of all its elements.

We will call such a traversal **iteration**.

## Array as a Sequence

Most data structures inherently support iteration (and therefore are sequences).

You should already be familiar with at least one data structure that is a sequence - the **array**.

You have probably written similar code more than once:

```cpp
// we have array "values"
for (size_t index = 0; index < size; ++index)
{
    auto& value = values[index];
    // do something with "value"
}
```

In essence, you were performing iteration over the array - traversing its elements from the first to the last, accessing them by **indices**.

## The Problem of Indexing

In fact, the overwhelming majority of problems involving sequences are solved using this _approach_ - iterating over all elements and processing them in some way.

The problem is that not all data structures that are sequences support **indexing** as an operation - what to do in this case?

We need some generalization for which iteration through indexing will be just a special case.
