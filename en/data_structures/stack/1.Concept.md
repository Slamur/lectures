A stack of pancakes (edible), a stack of dirty plates in the sink, Pringles chips in a can - what do these entities have in common?

All of these entities can be represented as a data structure with three simple operations:

- `push(value)` - place a value on top;
- `top()` - look at the top value;
- `pop()` - remove the top value.

Such a structure is called a **stack**.

A stack is said to be a structure with the "LIFO" principle - "Last in, first out" (the last added value will be the first to be removed).

## Stack is abstraction

It is important to understand that a stack is an **abstraction**. Unlike the previously studied structures (dynamic array and linked list), a stack does not have a canonical implementation.

Instead, a stack can be considered a **way of using** other data structures.

Let's consider the implementation of a stack using a dynamic array or linked list (was it in vain that we studied them?):

- `push(value)` is implemented through `push_back(value)`;
- `top()` is implemented through `back()`;
- `pop()` is implemented through `pop_back()`.

It can be noted that all three operations are implemented in $O(1)$ when using these structures.

In general, you can consider that this complexity is the expected default for stack implementations (but everything, obviously, depends on the requirements of the task).
